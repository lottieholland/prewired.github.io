As part of Prewired++ we ran a new version of our SummerHack, called the **Emporium of Digital Delights**, which ran from the 17th of May to July 2021. It consisted of a series of three Sprints (or hackathons), each of which lasted 12 days. You could participate in any one of them, or any two, or all three. After all the Sprints were completed, the Emporium will launch a digital showcase, which can be browsed here: [eodd.prewired.org](https://eodd.prewired.org/)!

* What is involved? You will be working in a small team, collaborating on a small project.
* Will there be prizes? Yes. At the end of the week, each team will give a demo of their project, and prizes will be awarded in various categories.
* Do you need to bring a laptop? Not necessarily &mdash; we can provide one.
* What about food? We will provide snacks but you will need to bring your own lunch.

<!-- ## Theme and Challenges: Improving our Environment

The theme of this year's Summer Hack will be the environment. On the principle of "think globally, act locally", we will explore how digital technology can help to make the city we live in more sustainable, healthy and friendly towards nature. The challenges for the Summer Hack will contribute to this theme in different ways.


The world &mdash; and our city &mdash; faces three major environmental problems:

1. Loss of biodiversity, including insect pollinators.
2. Global warming caused by CO2 emissions.
3. Air pollution, due to emissions from a variety of sources.

For the Summer Hack, we want to consider ways of using digital technology that will contribute towards solutions.

In order to think about more specific ways of addressing these problems,  have a look at this
[page with possible approaches]({{ "/summerhack2019/approaches.html" | absolute_url }}).
