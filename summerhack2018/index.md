## Overview

We are excited to announce that we are running **Summer Hack** again this year &mdash; a week-long team programming competition for young people of secondary school age (aged 12 and over).

<!-- **Registration**: You can register by filling in the registration form, we will get in touch with more details nearer the time: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/cwolczUwfViOJMOT2" target="_blank">Registration form</a> 

The Summer Hack will take place 10:00 am  &ndash; 4:00 pm every day, July 23rd&ndash;27th 2018 at [CodeBase Events Space](https://goo.gl/maps/KD9Gru6wjzr), 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 9SJ. Details of the schedule will be announced nearer the time. 

* What is involved? You will be working in a small team, collaborating on a small project.
* Will there be prizes? Yes. At the end of the week, each team will give a demo of their project, and prizes will be awarded in various categories.
* Do you need to bring a laptop? Not necessarily &mdash; we can provide one.
* What about food? We will provide snacks but you will need to bring your own lunch.

**Important**: because you will be working as a member of a team, you must commit to attending every day during the Summer Hack.


Details of the schedule are shown below.
